            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>My Tech High, Inc.</h4>

            <p>I really like MTH’s use of visual hierarchy. The first thing that catches your attention is the big, bold
                statement of Personalized Education. Then you notice their logo because it is colorful and surrounded by
                white space. Then you see a little more explanation leading to an application link, a video for more
                information, or a button to contact them. I do have one critique, though. They have not formatted their
                headline text to correctly shrink on a mobile device, so “Personalized” does not all fit on one line. I
                think that is a relatively easy fix, but not something they’ve done.</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Wal-mart, Inc.</h4>

            <p>Walmart makes good use of Hick’s Law in their homepage. Let’s face it, Walmart sells pretty much
                everything we could ever need. It’d be really easy for their website to be overwhelming. But they’ve
                done a good job in setting it up to make it easy for consumers to navigate. When you log in, the top of
                the page has an open search box, perfect for the buyer that knows exactly what they’ve looking for. Then
                underneath, they have a picture window scrolling through a set of ads that are high interest. For
                example, the first ad right now is for Mother’s Day – which is this upcoming Sunday. These items take up
                the majority of the page, giving us a limited amount of choices right in front of us that should pique
                the interest of most shoppers. If none of these interest you, as you scroll down, things get more
                general and geared towards person that is just browsing.</p>

            <h3>White Space & Clean Design</h3>
            <h4>Huge, Inc.</h4>
            <h4><a href="https://www.hugeinc.com/">hugeinc.com</a></h4>
            <br>
            <img src="images/huge.png" alt="Huge Mobile Site Screenshot">
            <br>
            <p>I love this site’s design in general. I feel they exemplify white space and clean design. When you first
                log in, all you see is their logo (H) with a greeting (that starts with their logo, like Hi or Hello)
                surrounded by empty space. You feel like you’re actually being greeted. Then at the bottom of the page,
                there is a small line of Today at Huge, with a vertical line under it that goes off the bottom of the
                page. You expect that it’s going to be an arrow pointing down. The “today at huge” is a great hook to
                get you curious, while the line directs you to scroll down to see what it says. This is followed by a
                series of pages with minimal text and imagery, but always with the logo top center, and links to
                different headlines about things the company is currently involved in. At the bottom is the nav section
                of the page. It’s very clean, you always know exactly what the site wants you to look at and are not
                bombarded by a ton of extras that could distract you.</p>
